# Creative Coding

### What is creative coding?

Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. It is used to create art, visual effects, music, websites, and much more. Creative coding is a broad field with many different applications, and it can be used by artists, designers, musicians, and other creative professionals to bring their ideas to life.

## L√©man Pulse

**L√©man pulse** is a poetic project that aims to map the landscape around L√©man lake according to people's interactions and communications taking place on this site and shaping them into new
subjective landscapes. L√©man lake is a central spot in Geneva, hosting several of the city's main attractions, and a meeting point for both tourists and locals alike. Although each of these groups seems to engage with the lake in different ways (with tourists being more interested in recording proves of their presence, while genevois tend to be more adept of exploring whole presence interactions through direct physical activities) is it clear that the lake shores play an important role in social imaginary.
